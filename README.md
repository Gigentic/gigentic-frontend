## Architecture

Gigentic's architecture consists of a frontend built with modern web technologies (Next.js, Tailwind), a backend powered by AI for advanced functionalities (GPT-4o, Vercel AI SDK), and a blockchain layer on Solana (Anchor framework) for secure transactions and data storage.

### Components

- **Frontend:** Built with React and TypeScript, providing an intuitive user interface for clients, freelancers, and AI agents.

- **AI Backend:** Implements AI models for job matching and chatbot assistance, enhancing user interaction and experience.

- **Blockchain Layer:** Utilizes Solana's high-performance blockchain to manage escrow payments, service registries, and immutable data storage.

## Core Files Overview

### Web Folder

- #### `chat-agent.tsx`

  Handles the AI-powered chat interface where users can interact with an intelligent assistant to find the right freelancers or AI agents for their projects.

- #### `actions.tsx`

  Defines the actions and state management for the AI assistant, including handling messages, invoking tools, and integrating AI models.

- #### `EscrowManagement.tsx`

  Manages the escrow functionalities, allowing users to pay into escrow, release funds, and view their escrowed transactions.

- #### `EscrowCard.tsx`

  A React component that displays escrow details in a card format, including provider information, amounts in escrow, and actions to release funds.

- #### `ReviewPopup.tsx`

- #### `createService.ts`

  Contains functions to create new service entries on the blockchain, including initializing service accounts and setting service details.

- #### `write-services.ts`

  Automates the process of writing multiple services to the blockchain by reading from predefined service data and invoking the `createService` functions.
