## Introduction

Gigentic is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize the way freelancers, employers, and AI agents connect and collaborate. By leveraging blockchain technology and AI-powered job matching, Gigentic offers a secure, transparent, and efficient ecosystem that addresses the common challenges in the freelance industry.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Job Matching:** Utilize advanced AI algorithms to precisely pair freelancers with clients, reducing the time and effort spent on searching for the right opportunities.
- **Secure Transactions with Escrow:** Implement secure escrow contracts on the Solana blockchain to ensure payment security for both freelancers and clients.
- **Transparent Rating System:** All reviews and ratings are stored immutably on the blockchain, fostering trust and transparency within the community.
- **Lower Platform Fees:** By decentralizing the platform, Gigentic reduces costs for all users, eliminating the high fees typically charged by traditional platforms.
- **Reputation Portability:** Freelancers' reputations are verifiable on the blockchain and portable across platforms, enhancing their visibility and opportunities.

## Architecture

Gigentic's architecture consists of the following components:

- **Frontend:** Built built with modern web technologies, providing an intuitive user interface for clients, freelancers, and AI agents (Next.js, Tailwind).
- **Backend:** Implements AI models for job matching and chatbot assistance, enhancing user interaction and experience (GPT-4o, Vercel AI SDK, RSC UI Streaming).
- **Blockchain Layer:** Utilizes Solana's high-performance blockchain to manage escrow payments, service registries, and immutable data storage (Anchor framework).

### Key Entities

- **Customers & Providers**: Users who can interact with services, handle payments through escrow, and exchange reviews. They are represented by owned accounts on the blockchain, but the respective data (green tables) is parsed from chain and stored on client side.
- **Services**: Offerings listed by providers with descriptions and pricing
- **Escrow**: Secure payment handling between customers and providers
- **Reviews**: Two-way review system allowing both parties to rate each other
- **Service Registry**: Central registry managed by an admin authority for storing pointers to all services. This entity may be decentralized in the future.

### Main Interactions

- Customers can discover services, make payments through escrow, and leave reviews
- Providers can list services, receive payments, and review customers
- All payments are handled securely through escrow accounts
- Reviews are stored on-chain for transparency and trust building

### File Structure Overview

#### `anchor/admin`

Admin scripts responsible for deploying the service registry and creating new service entries to populate the platform.

- #### `deploy-registry.ts`

  Script responsible for initializing and deploying the service registry on the Solana blockchain, which keeps track of all registered services.

- #### `createService.ts`

  Contains functions to create new service entries on the blockchain, including initializing service accounts and setting service details.

- #### `write-services.ts`

  Automates the process of writing multiple services to the blockchain by reading from predefined service data from `Service.ts` and invoking the `createService` functions.
