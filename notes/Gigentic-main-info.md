Gigentic Agent is a decentralized platform that transforms the future of work by enabling users to both utilize and create AI agents for specific tasks. The platform allows experts to monetize their knowledge by creating and offering customized AI agents to other users, while maintaining transparent, on-chain reputation scores based on their agents' performance and user satisfaction. Users can access these agents using blockchain-based payments, with all interactions verifiably tracked on-chain in a zero-knowledge way, creating a trustless ecosystem for human-AI collaboration. The agents in the platform could potentially give financial or medical advice, so liability becomes a crucial concept. We want to create a system where for example a human financial advisor can endow his license to his agent and do controlling and compliance of the agent's answers and actions. The system shall also allow users to create tokens for the agent that might have some set utility. The platform shall have it's own native token as well.
