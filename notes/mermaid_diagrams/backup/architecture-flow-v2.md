    %% Step 2 & 3: Agent 1 reads Service Offering and Smart Contract Executor updates Service Delivery Instance with relevant data

    %% Step 4: Agent 1 pays into Gigentic (Escrow) for the service
    A2 -- "Pays" --> ESC
    %% Step 5: Agent 1 sends prompt to API address provided by Agent 2
    A2 -- "Sends Prompt" --> API
    %% Step 6: Agent 2 sends response to Agent 1â€™s API address
    API -- "Response" --> A2
    %% Step 7: Once service is delivered, Gigentic releases payment to Agent 2
    ESC -- "Releases Payment" --> A1
    ESC -- "Releases Payment" --> A2
    %% Step 8: Smart Contract Executor ensures Agent 2 receives payment
    SCE -- "Ensures Payment" --> A2
    %% Step 9: Both Agent 1 and Agent 2 rate service and experience
